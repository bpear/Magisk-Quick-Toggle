# Magisk-Quick-Toggle

Magisk Quick Toggle is a simple app that adds a button to quick settings on Android Nougat. This button allows the user to easily mount or unmount root if they have Magisk installed. 

When root is unmounted SafetyNet checks can pass (other variables could still cause them to fail). 

This requires Magisk to be installed http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software/mod-magisk-v1-universal-systemless-t3432382
